⏺ Great shortlist! Here's my take on each:

  | Name              | Pros                                           | Cons                                             |
  |-------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
  | PersonaLab        | Clear, professional, implies research          | "Persona" is common in marketing tools           |
  | AudienceAI        | Modern, clear AI element                       | Generic, many tools use "AI" suffix              |
  | AudienceLab       | Clean, professional, research-focused          | Similar names may exist                          |
  | AudienceWhisperer | Memorable, unique, implies deep understanding  | Long, harder to type as URL                      |
  | AvatarLab         | Unique, ties to your "avatar analysis" feature | "Avatar" might confuse (profile pics?)           |
  | ProductInsights   | Clear purpose                                  | Sounds more like analytics than content creation |
  | AudienceInsights  | Descriptive, professional                      | Could be confused with Facebook's tool           |

  ---
  My ranking:

  1. AudienceLab - Clean, memorable, professional. "Lab" suggests experimentation and research. Easy to say, type, spell.
  2. PersonaLab - Strong second. Clear what it does. Slightly more unique than AudienceLab.
  3. AudienceWhisperer - Most memorable and unique. Great for branding/storytelling. But longer.
  4. AvatarLab - Good if you lean into the "avatar analysis" terminology your app already uses.
