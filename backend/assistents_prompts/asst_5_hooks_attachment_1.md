# Viral Hooks Manual for Instagram and TikTok Ads

## Introduction

In today's digital advertising landscape, capturing audience attention in the first 2-3 seconds of an ad is crucial. Platforms like TikTok and Instagram are saturated with content, and studies show that most users decide whether they'll watch a video in just a couple of seconds. In fact, 63% of videos with the highest click-through rates (CTR) manage to "hook" their audience in the first 3 seconds. We call this initial moment the "hook," and it's the key to stopping the scroll and getting viewers to stay and watch the complete ad.

In the context of info products, high-ticket services, and investments, a good hook can make the difference between a successful ad and one that goes unnoticed. The hook doesn't seek to sell immediately, but rather to capture attention and spark curiosity; once the user stops, then they can hear your message or offer. This manual compiles the most viral formulas and hooks that are working best lately on Instagram Reels and TikTok, categorized for easy application. The goal is for any copywriter to use this "recipe book" and, following the method, find winning hooks for their ads.

## What is a Viral "Hook" and Why Does it Matter?

A hook is the first impression of your content: that headline, opening phrase, image, or action that grabs the viewer's attention and entices them to keep watching. On social media, the hook seeks to spark curiosity, provoke reflection, evoke emotions, or generate the desire to know more about your message. In other words, the hook acts as a "scroll stopper": it stops the user dead in their tracks with something striking or relevant. If the hook fails, the user will keep scrolling and all the creative effort is lost.

In a world of information overload, the average attention span is barely ~8 seconds – and on TikTok even less. An effective hook "buys" those initial seconds so the audience becomes interested. The greater the retention you achieve with a good hook, the more likely the viewer will hear your complete message and take action (plus, platforms reward retention by showing content to more people). In summary, without a good hook there's no possible conversion, which is why marketing experts like Russell Brunson emphasize that everything starts with a powerful hook before being able to tell the story and offer your product (Hook-Story-Offer).

### What Makes a Hook Effective?

It must fulfill several key elements:

**Capture attention immediately**: This can be through text, image, or impactful phrase that breaks the pattern and surprises the user. For example, starting a video saying "Watch this if you want to earn $100,000 in 13 hours" is an opening that almost forces you to pause scrolling.

**Spark curiosity or intrigue**: If you reveal everything from the start, there's no reason to keep watching. A good hook plants a question or mystery (curiosity gap) that makes the audience want to know the answer.

**Be relevant to the target audience**: Speak directly about a problem, desire, or common situation of your audience. A hook works when the viewer thinks "this is about me." Addressing the user with "you" or calling out their profile ("If you're [target audience]...") creates instant personal connection.

**Generate emotion or urgency**: This can be amazement, fear of missing out (FOMO), surprise, identification, or even humor. For example, using alarm words like "dangerous" or "secret" activates the psychological urgency to pay attention. Also introducing temporality or scarcity (e.g., "only today," "in 5 seconds") adds pressure not to miss details.

**Maintain authenticity and conversational tone**: Today's audience prefers authentic and close content, not rigid ads. Opening with a colloquial phrase or direct question sounds more like conversation than advertising. This generates trust and makes the hook more shareable (people tend to share content with surprising or useful hooks).

In summary, a viral hook stops scrolling and promises value to the viewer without revealing it completely. Next, we'll explore the main categories of proven hooks in viral ads, with formulas and examples you can adapt to your niche (whether it's an educational info product, high-value coaching service, or financial investment offer).

## Types of Viral Hooks (and How to Apply Them)

Below are different categories of hooks that are working especially well on TikTok and Instagram in 2024-2025. Each type includes specific formulas and examples, so you can copy them, adapt them to your topic, and combine them according to your strategy. Note: Many hooks can overlap in categories (for example, a question can include a number, etc.), but we've separated them for clarity.

### 1. Direct Question Hook

Starting your ad with a direct question is a powerful way to engage the audience. Psychologically, when someone sees or hears a question, they automatically try to answer it in their mind. This creates instant interaction and makes the person feel part of the conversation. A question-format hook should target a pain point, desire, or curiosity of your audience.

**Examples and formulas:**

- **"Can you imagine if you could (DESIRED RESULT)...?"** – Invites the dream or aspiration of the target audience.
    
    - Example: "Can you imagine earning $10,000 a month from the comfort of your home?" (ideal for online business info products).
- **"Have you ever wondered why (PROBLEM/PAIN POINT)...?"** – Poses the origin of a common problem, generating intrigue about the answer.
    
    - Example: "Have you ever wondered why some investors always win while others lose money?" (hook for investment niche).
- **"Are you struggling with (PAIN POINT)? ..."** – Acknowledges a direct viewer problem and suggests you'll give the solution.
    
    - Example: "Are you struggling to organize your time? Then try this trick I wish I had known before..."
- **"Are you tired of (PAIN POINT)? ..."** – Similar to above, appeals to user fatigue/frustration and promises a new method.
    
    - Example: "Are you tired of diets that don't work? Then try this..."
- **"What if I told you that (surprising achievement/solution)?"** – Classic formula that provokes curiosity. Incites thinking "what if that were true?"
    
    - Example: "What if I told you there's a simple way to earn $1,000 a month with just one app?"

This type of hook works excellently for educational info products (e.g., "Did you know 90% of people fail at learning English because of this mistake?"), or coaching services ("Do you want to achieve X but don't know how?"). The right question makes the audience stop to think and want to hear the answer you're offering.

### 2. Numbers, Percentages, or Data Hook

Using concrete numbers in the first seconds adds credibility and awakens the viewer's rational side. People are attracted to tangible and specific facts, which is why good marketers often include metrics in their hooks. A number can promise a benefit ("Earn $5,000") or highlight a massive problem ("80% fail at X").

**Some viral formulas with data:**

- **"Why X% of (people) (fail at / don't achieve) (GOAL)..."** – Points out how widespread the problem is and generates intrigue about the cause.
    
    - Example: "Why 99% of cold emails don't get responses" (poses a marketing problem).
- **"X% of (AUDIENCE) (suffers/problem), and here's why..."** – Another variant to give hard data followed by explanation.
    
    - Example: "60% of small businesses fail in their first 5 years, and here's why" (ideal for capturing entrepreneurs).
- **"This mistake could cost you (AMOUNT/LOSSES)..."** – Quantified warning of something negative, excellent for investment/finance.
    
    - Example: "This mistake could cost you millions in your retirement." (Listeners will want to know which error to avoid).
- **"I achieved X RESULT in Y TIME..."** – Concrete achievement data that acts as instant social proof.
    
    - Example: "How I got 100,000 followers in 2 months" (shows impressive milestone to attract social media coaches).
- **"Only N people know (DATA/SECRET)..."** – Hints at rarity/exclusivity of certain information, using a number to emphasize it.
    
    - Example: "Only 1% know this financial trick that multiplies savings" (mixes data + curiosity).

When using numbers, also promise brevity: the viewer feels "it's worth investing 30 seconds in this video because it will give me 5 valuable tips." In investment or marketing sectors, examples abound: "The strategy that generated 30% more return in 2024," "5 metrics you should watch before investing," etc. Numbers anchor your hook in something concrete and professional that stands out in the feed.

### 3. Demonstration or Experiment Hook ("Show, Don't Tell")

Another winning formula is presenting your content as the result of an experiment, challenge, or personal investigation. Instead of just promising, you demonstrate that you already did something and will share what happened. This type of hook adds credibility (social proof) and usually intrigues us because we want to know the outcome. Apply the idea "I got my hands dirty so you don't have to."

**Examples:**

- **"I tested all the (TRICKS/METHODS) to (achieve X), so you don't have to."** – Excellent for how-to info products, saving the audience effort.
    
    - Example: "I've tested all productivity hacks so you don't have to" (indicates you'll filter the best).
- **"What happens when (you do X / Y happens)?"** – Poses the video as an experiment whose result will be revealed.
    
    - Example: "This is what happens when you achieve financial freedom" (promises to show real consequences).
- **"Let's find out why (PROBLEM)..."** – Invites the viewer to "investigate with you" the cause of something.
    
    - Example: "Let's find out why many entrepreneurs struggle to manage their time" (collaborative/educational hook style).
- **"This is how I (ACHIEVEMENT) in (TIME)."** – Presents content as condensed tutorial, result of experience.
    
    - Example: "This is how we increased web traffic by 30% in just 30 days" (shows a proven step-by-step process will be revealed).
- **"Exposing my secret to (RESULT)."** – Announces you'll reveal a personal "secret" that led to X achievement.
    
    - Example: "My secret to recording a month of content in 1 day."

These hooks work very well in investment topics ("I experimented investing in meme crypto for 1 month, this happened"), fitness ("What happens if you do 100 push-ups daily for 30 days?"), or marketing ("This is how I got 50 daily leads without spending on ads"). The key is showing results or lessons learned (social proof) instead of just claims. As the marketing saying goes: "Show, don't tell," and an experimental hook promises exactly that.

### 4. Tension, Alarm, or Powerful Language Hook

On saturated platforms, sometimes whoever generates visceral impact wins attention. This type of hook employs words and phrases that trigger red alerts in the viewer's brain. These are hooks that sound controversial, extreme, or even alarming. For example, hearing "illegal," "dangerous," or "stop doing this now," users almost instinctively stop to pay attention.

**Typical formulas (used with caution):**

- **"These X tricks seem illegal to know."** – This phrase became trending because it suggests the knowledge is so good it "should be prohibited."
    
    - Example: "These 3 productivity hacks seem illegal they're so effective" (has been a viral hook in business niches).
- **"Stop doing (SOMETHING) right now. Instead, (benefit)..."** – Strong command that first scares ("what am I doing wrong?") then offers alternative.
    
    - Example: "Stop following these dangerous diets right now! Do this instead..."
- **"X is dead."** – Declaring something popular "has died" is controversial and generates debate.
    
    - Example: "Traditional marketing is dead" or "SMMA agencies are dead." (Immediately polarizes; those who disagree will watch to refute, and those who believe will watch seeking confirmation).
- **"The dark secret behind (SOMETHING)..."** – Suggests there's a hidden and negative truth in something known.
    
    - Example: "The dark secret behind investment funds." (Perfect for exposé or revelation-type videos).
- **"Nobody has told you this, but (SOMETHING)..."** – Implies you've discovered information nobody else reveals, creating exclusivity.
    
    - Example: "Nobody has told you this, but hashtags no longer work in 2025" (eye-catching for marketers).
- **"This (error/habit) could destroy your (GOAL) in seconds."** – Dramatic warning of serious consequence if you continue doing X.
    
    - Example: "This financial error could ruin your retirement in 5 seconds."

These hooks carry the risk of sounding sensationalistic, so they must be used with authenticity and only if the content really justifies that tone. When well-aligned (for example, a real investment alert: "Danger!: this crypto scam is ruining novices"), they achieve very high retention rates. The advice is to use them for exceptional videos where tension corresponds with the message, avoiding overusing them in all content. Well employed, they spike curiosity and stop scrolling through immediate shock.

### 5. Surprise, Curiosity, or "Uncomfortable Truth" Hook

Surprise is perhaps the most powerful hook online – we love when something challenges our expectations. This category includes hooks that reveal hidden truths, curious facts, amazing data, or simply contradict what people think they know. Many successful creators use "the hard truth" or negation ("everything you know about X is wrong") to hook.

**Some formats of this style:**

- **"This is why your (action/strategy) doesn't work."** – A "I'll tell you why you're failing" type hook, appealing to the desire to correct it.
    
    - Example: "This is why your investment strategy doesn't work." (The investor will want to know what's wrong).
- **"Don't hate me, but (UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTH)."** – Introduces an unpopular opinion or hard-to-accept truth, preparing the listener for something frank.
    
    - Example: "Don't hate me, but the hard truth about success is that not everyone is willing to pay the price."
- **"Everything you knew about X is 100% wrong."** – Classic pattern-breaker. Claims common knowledge is wrong, inciting to know the correction.
    
    - Example: "Everything you knew about diets is 100% wrong!" (Who wouldn't want to hear what's correct?).
- **"This is the only thing you need to know about (TOPIC)."** – Poses that you'll simplify a complex topic into one key truth.
    
    - Example: "This is the only thing you need to know about investing successfully" (Generates expectation of simple but key revelation).
- **"Did you know that (SURPRISING FACT)?"** – Appeal to curious or counterintuitive data in question form.
    
    - Example: "Did you know honey never expires?" (as educational hook; even if unrelated to product, captures interest).
- **"The craziest thing just happened in (PLACE), you won't believe it."** – Surprising news-style format, very useful for capturing attention with storytelling.
    
    - Example: "The craziest thing happened in the stock market today, you won't believe it!" (Ideal for investment niche hook telling incredible market event).
- **"Forget everything you know about X."** – Negation variant, tells audience they must restart their knowledge because something disruptive is coming.
    
    - Example: "Forget everything you know about Instagram marketing (today the rules are different)."
- **"Stop doing (typical something) if you want (GOAL)."** – This hook mixes negation with promise, breaking common habit to achieve desired result.
    
    - Example: "Stop chasing clients one by one if you want to scale your sales to 6 figures."
- **"The biggest secret about X that nobody told you."** – Suggests there's crucial knowledge you've been excluded from, creating much curiosity.
    
    - Example: "The biggest secret about building your company that nobody has told you."
- **"Other (referents/competitors) are lying to you."** – Aggressive but striking hook, positions itself as the only one telling the truth.
    
    - Example: "Financial gurus are lying to you: this is what they don't tell you."

All these formats, well used, pique viewer curiosity and force them to stay to hear the promised explanation or revelation. They're perfect for disruptive info products (that challenge industry myths) or consulting services (that offer novel approaches). Even TikTok itself suggests hooks like "Did you know...?" or "Here's the truth about..." to educate the audience. Just make sure to then deliver content that meets expectations; if you promise to reveal "the only secret" and then it's not impactful, you'll lose credibility.

### 6. List or Enumeration Hook ("Listicle hook")

"There's nothing better than a list to hook your viewers" states a recent study on viral content. Humans love lists because they're concrete, organized, and promise multiple value (e.g., several tips in one video). On social media, hooks mentioning lists work excellently and also invite saving content for later consultation.

**Typical listicle hook formulas:**

- **"X steps to (ACHIEVE GOAL)."**
    
    - Example: "5 steps to increase your website traffic."
- **"X ways to (ACHIEVE GOAL)."**
    
    - Example: "3 ways to save money without giving up treats."
- **"X (niche elements) you should know..."** – Useful for resource lists, tools, etc.
    
    - Example: "3 social media strategies that boost your growth."
- **"The N secrets of (goal)."**
    
    - Example: "The 4 secrets of millionaire investors."
- **"Here are N undervalued (tips/hacks) for (goal)."** – Appeals to little-known advice (double hook: list + surprise).
    
    - Example: "Here are 3 little-known tricks to lose weight fast."
- **"N things about (topic) I wish I knew before."** – Very used for sharing retrospective learnings.
    
    - Example: "3 things about real estate investing I wish I had known before."
- **"N mistakes you're probably making if you don't achieve X."** – Combines list + audience pain point.
    
    - Example: "5 mistakes you're probably making if you don't get online sales."

Enumerated lists work in practically any niche: finance ("7 budget-killing expenses"), education ("3 golden rules for learning a language"), fitness ("5 exercises to define abs"), etc. Plus, they're hooks that clearly structure your content from the start, preparing the viewer for an organized, valuable video. An additional benefit: on Instagram/TikTok many users save or share "tip list" videos, increasing their organic reach. So if your goal is visibility and branding, this type of hook is highly recommended.

### 7. Personal Story and Authority Hook

Your own experience is a powerful hook – as long as you use it strategically. People are attracted to real stories and knowing about successful people's trajectories. If you're an expert in your field, showing a glimpse of your personal achievement in the hook can give instant validity to your message. However, be cautious: if nobody knows you yet, a hook talking about yourself might not engage unless it offers clear value to the listener. The key is presenting your experience linked to audience benefit.

**Examples of personal hooks:**

- **"This is how I achieved (ACHIEVEMENT)."** – Direct and effective, promises to reveal how you reached a desirable result.
    
    - Example: "This is how I got 10,000 followers in 30 days" (Shows you speak with authority on social growth).
- **"This simple trick helped me (ACHIEVEMENT) and can help you too."** – Combines personal proof + transferable benefit to viewer.
    
    - Example: "This simple trick helped me quit my 9-5 job and can help you too."
- **"How I went from (SITUATION A) to (SITUATION B) in (TIME)."** – Summarized narrative format, excellent for telling transformation stories.
    
    - Example: "How I went from bankruptcy to 7-figure billing in just 3 years." (Incredible transformation that intrigues entrepreneurs).
- **"If I had to start over (in X)..."** – Phrase that hooks because it appeals to acquired wisdom (listener wants advice from someone with experience).
    
    - Example: "If I had to start over in real estate investing, I would do this..."
- **"Mistakes I made when (doing X)."** – Shows humility and learning, which generates trust and teaches audience to avoid the same.
    
    - Example: "Mistakes I made launching my first startup (so you don't repeat them)."
- **"I've always been (negative characteristic), but (achievement/change)..."** – Confession-style hook of personal overcoming.
    
    - Example: "I've always been terrible at selling, but I managed to turn that weakness into my strength."

These hooks work very well for personal brands, coaches, mentors, and premium course sellers, where authority and founder's story matter. Russell Brunson popularized in marketing the "Hook, Story, Offer" formula where after the initial hook you tell a story (often personal) before making your offer. Starting with your achievement or personal lesson opens the door to that story. Important: don't fall into just bragging; connect your story with how the viewer can achieve the same or what useful learning they take away. A good practice is using "I" only to establish credentials and quickly switch to "you" to focus on audience benefit. This maintains interest in what they gain from your experience.

## Visual Enhancement and Format Guidelines

While the 7 hook categories above focus on the verbal/textual elements, visual components play a crucial complementary role in stopping the scroll. This section provides guidance on visual elements that can amplify your text hooks, but should be considered as production enhancements rather than separate hook categories.

### Visual Pattern Interrupts

Not all hooks depend solely on words; on social media, visuals rule. A visual "pattern interrupt" – something unexpected that appears on screen – can stop scrolling even without sound. As a video ad copywriter, you must coordinate text with visual elements in those first seconds to amplify impact.

**Visual tactics and trends that work:**

- **Sudden or unusual actions**: For example, starting the video making a brusque movement (throwing an object, jumping, turning the camera) or showing something out of the ordinary. A popular case is starting with phone in hand then dropping it or placing it aside facing the camera – that movement attracts the gaze through its spontaneity. Another example seen: someone appearing surprisingly (like a subject emerging from ice water in a Red Bull ad) – that type of unexpected scene combines visual and verbal hook simultaneously.
    
- **"Mini mic" or curious objects**: A recent trend is using a tiny microphone when speaking to camera. It seems trivial, but this visual detail generates curiosity and credibility at once (seems like you're "reporting something important" in a fun way). Brands like Fenty Beauty have used it to capture attention in Reels. Any striking object related to your niche can work as initial prop if it surprises (example: appearing counting bills in a finance hook, or with giant scissors in a hook about cutting expenses).
    
- **Product or element entrance**: If promoting a physical product, an effective technique is making the product appear immediately dynamically. For example, sliding the product into screen at second 1, or even more advanced: "pulling" a product from screen or image (popular special effect in UGC). This captures attention and demonstrates upfront what the ad is about. In non-physical services, you could show an impactful graphic or giant figure on screen at the start.
    
- **Multitasking or ongoing activity**: Another visual formula is starting the video doing another task – cleaning something, serving coffee, walking – while talking. That background action adds movement and naturalness, hooking those who feel like voyeurs of an everyday scene. For example, a financial advisor could appear organizing bills on a table while saying the hook, visually reinforcing the money theme.
    
- **Large text and dynamic subtitles**: Always accompany your verbal hook with highlighted on-screen text. It can be a meme-style title (like viral pages do, putting a funny or controversial header on top). Plus, using subtitles is fundamental: you not only make your video accessible to those watching silently or with hearing problems, but stylized text itself calls attention. TikTok reported many users watch videos without sound, so if in the first seconds they see powerful text, they'll keep reading even if not listening. Tools like Submagic and others allow generating subtitles with striking styles like top creators (MrBeast, etc.) easily. A well-placed subtitle reinforcing your hook (e.g., appearing a big "ATTENTION!" or the exact phrase you say) acts as second visual hook.
    

### Combining Visual and Verbal Elements

In summary, think about moving images as much as words. The best creators combine both: for example, they say "If you're an entrepreneur, stop doing this" while showing a big red ❌ over an image of something typical on screen. That double audiovisual impact maximizes retention. Remember that "scrolls are won with the weird, not the polite" – in other words, dare to use unconventional elements that break feed monotony. An effective pattern interrupt in initial seconds will make users stay to see your message, fulfilling the hook's mission.

**Note for Hook Creation**: When writing hooks, you can reference visual elements descriptively (e.g., "Watch what happens when I..." or "Look at this result...") but the primary focus should remain on crafting compelling verbal hooks that work with or without specific visual elements.

We've reviewed multiple hook formulas, but how to apply them consistently? Here are some final recommendations from experts and best practices to refine your hooks:

- **Know your audience and their "pain points"**: The best hook speaks directly to what your customer desires or worries about. In Dan Melnick's words, you must "speak to your target audience's greatest pain or desire" in those first seconds. Make a list of your prospects' frustrations and goals and use them in your questions, calls, and promises.
    
- **Be brief and get to the point**: Don't embellish or ramble at the start. An effective hook usually uses few words and goes straight to the shocking or interesting point. Avoid unnecessary introductions ("Hi, I'm going to talk to you about..."); launch with the strongest phrase from second 0. As Brendan Kane (author of "Hook Point: How to Stand Out in a 3-Second World") says, seek to "use the fewest possible words while combining something common with something unique."
    
- **Subvert expectations**: Viral hooks often break with the expected. It can be a counterintuitive phrase, shocking image, or starting with a twist. For example, starting an investment ad saying "Your bank has been lying to you..." is unexpected and hooks. The idea, as Kane points out, is making people think differently than usual in those first seconds.
    
- **Don't reveal the ending too early**: Maintain a "curiosity gap." If your video will explain 5 tips, don't preview them in the hook, simply promise they exist. A copywriting tip is leaving the question open: for example, instead of "I'm going to teach you to get 100 clients with Facebook Ads," you could say "This is how we got 100 clients in 1 month (and almost nobody is using it)." This way the audience knows what you achieved (result) but not how, and will watch the rest to find out.
    
- **Make it feel like personal conversation**: Hooks said in conversational tone (as if talking to a friend) usually perform better than very polished or corporate ones. That's why openings with questions, brief anecdotes, or even colloquial expressions work well. People on social media don't want stiff commercials, they want genuine content. Even starting with quick "Storytelling" can work: "When I was 18 I made a financial mistake that almost cost me everything..." – this narrated phrase hooks because it promises a real story that will derive learning.
    
- **Always deliver what you promise**: A bad habit is creating super striking hooks but then content doesn't respond (which would be pure empty clickbait). Avoid this at all costs; a disappointed user will hardly trust again. If you open with "The biggest secret for X," make sure to reveal a secret that's really valuable or unexpected. Consistency between hook and content builds long-term credibility.
    
- **Iterate and test different hooks**: Don't marry just one type. What's viral today might saturate tomorrow. For example, certain very hackneyed hooks (like "3 tips for X..." without greater creativity) no longer have the same effect in 2025 due to overuse. The recommendation is preparing multiple hook variations for the same ad and testing which generates better retention. Even platforms like Facebook Ads let you test different video openings. Analyze retention metrics: you'll see which phrase or style makes people stay longer. Optimizing hooks is a continuous process.
    
- **Get inspired by references and resources**: Study those who do it well. For example, Mr. Beast (on YouTube) is famous for spending tons of time perfecting the first seconds of his videos – he always poses an extreme or surprising scenario immediately to trap viewers. In ads, the Harmon Brothers (agency behind virals like Squatty Potty) start with humor and visual shock elements to ensure nobody passes the ad by. There are also books and guides about hooks: "Hook Point" by Brendan Kane already mentioned, copywriting courses including opening sections, etc. Many examples compiled here come from analyzing hundreds of viral videos and even specialized tools (for example, Submagic shared 75 trending hooks 2025, and in marketing communities they give away viral hook lists). Stay updated following blogs and creators who discuss the topic, since trending formulas evolve quickly.
    

In conclusion, mastering the art of the hook is indispensable for any copywriter focused on direct response ads on social media. Think of the hook as your video's red carpet: it must be attractive for the audience to decide to enter. With the categories, formulas, and examples provided in this manual, you have a broad repertoire for creating effective hooks. Use them ethically and creatively, adapting them to your product/service. Remember: "The first 3 seconds can make or break your ad. Lose attention, lose the sale." Apply these viral hooks, stop the scroll, and boost your conversions!
