guidelines:
  - Base objections on realistic avatar concerns from previous analysis
  - Order objections by priority within each type (most impactful first)
  - Provide specific, actionable arguments for overcoming each objection
  - Suggest concrete incentives that address the specific objection type
  - Ensure objections align with the avatar's psychographic profile
  - Include both emotional and logical elements in responses
  - Make arguments credible and evidence-based where possible
  - Tailor incentives to the avatar's economic sensitivity and preferences

examples:
  solution_objection_example: |
    {
      "priority": 1,
      "objection_description": "Avatar believes they can learn AI on their own through free resources and doesn't need a structured program, thinking 'I'm smart enough to figure this out myself'",
      "argument_to_overcome": "While free resources exist, they lack the strategic business integration and proven frameworks that turn AI knowledge into actual income. Our system provides the missing bridge between AI tools and profitable business applications",
      "additional_incentive": "30-day implementation challenge with milestone tracking to prove faster results than self-learning"
    }

  offer_objection_example: |
    {
      "priority": 1,  
      "objection_description": "Avatar thinks the price is too high compared to cheaper AI courses available online, questioning 'Why should I pay more when I can get AI training for $49?'",
      "argument_to_overcome": "Those courses teach AI tools but don't teach business strategy. Our program combines both, which is why our students generate income while others just learn features. The price reflects the business coaching component, not just the technical training",
      "additional_incentive": "Revenue guarantee: If you don't generate at least the course fee in additional income within 90 days, get a full refund plus 50% bonus"
    }

  internal_objection_example: |
    {
      "priority": 1,
      "objection_description": "Avatar has fear of failure based on past experiences with online courses that promised results but didn't deliver, thinking 'I've been burned before by courses that overpromise'",
      "argument_to_overcome": "We understand that skepticism because we've seen those disappointing courses too. That's exactly why we built this differently - with real accountability, live support, and a proven track record of student success stories you can verify",
      "additional_incentive": "60-day money-back guarantee plus access to our private student success community where you can speak directly with current successful students"
    }

  external_objection_example: |
    {
      "priority": 1,
      "objection_description": "Avatar is concerned about economic uncertainty and job market instability, thinking 'With the economy being unpredictable, I should save money rather than invest in training'",
      "argument_to_overcome": "Economic uncertainty is exactly why you need multiple income streams. AI skills are recession-proof and high-demand. Companies are increasing AI budgets even when cutting other expenses, making this the safest career investment you can make",
      "additional_incentive": "Flexible payment plan: Pay in 3 installments over 6 months, plus job market protection guarantee - if you lose your job during the program, get 6 months free extension"
    }
