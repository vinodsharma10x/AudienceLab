viral_hooks_manual_principles: |
  KEY PRINCIPLES FROM VIRAL HOOKS MANUAL:
  
  1. CAPTURE ATTENTION IMMEDIATELY
  - Break the pattern and surprise the user
  - Use impactful phrases that force pause in scrolling
  - Start with something that makes viewer think "this is about me"
  
  2. SPARK CURIOSITY OR INTRIGUE  
  - Don't reveal everything from start
  - Plant a question or mystery (curiosity gap)
  - Make audience want to know the answer
  
  3. BE RELEVANT TO TARGET AUDIENCE
  - Speak directly about problems, desires, situations
  - Address user with "you" or call out their profile
  - Create instant personal connection
  
  4. GENERATE EMOTION OR URGENCY
  - Use amazement, FOMO, surprise, identification, humor
  - Include alarm words like "dangerous" or "secret"
  - Add temporality or scarcity ("only today," "in 5 seconds")
  
  5. MAINTAIN AUTHENTICITY
  - Conversational tone, not rigid ads
  - Open with colloquial phrase or direct question
  - Generate trust and shareability

hook_id_convention: |
  Hook IDs follow this pattern: "angle_{angle_number}_{sequential_number}"
  
  Sequential numbering within each angle (1-21 hooks per angle):
  - Hooks 1-3: direct_question category
  - Hooks 4-6: shocking_fact category  
  - Hooks 7-9: demonstration category
  - Hooks 10-12: alarm_tension category
  - Hooks 13-15: surprise_curiosity category
  - Hooks 16-18: list_enumeration category
  - Hooks 19-21: personal_story category
  
  Examples:
  - "angle_1_1" = Angle 1, First hook (direct_question)
  - "angle_1_7" = Angle 1, Seventh hook (demonstration)  
  - "angle_1_21" = Angle 1, Twenty-first hook (personal_story)
  - "angle_3_1" = Angle 3, First hook (direct_question)
  
  Each angle restarts numbering from 1, generating exactly 21 hooks per angle.

json_output_format: |
  ⚠️ CRITICAL OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS - MUST FOLLOW EXACTLY:
  - Return ONLY the JSON object
  - DO NOT wrap in markdown code blocks
  - DO NOT include ```json or ``` markers
  - DO NOT add any explanations or comments
  - Start directly with { and end with }
  - Use EXACT field names as shown below - do not modify them
  
  IMPORTANT: Your response MUST be valid JSON only. Do not return text, explanations, or any other format.
  Begin your response with { and end with }. Nothing else.
  
  ⚠️ REQUIRED FIELD NAMES (use these EXACTLY):
  - "angle_id" (not "id")
  - "angle_number" (not "number") 
  - "angle_category" (not "category")
  - "angle_concept" (not "concept") ← CRITICAL: Must include "angle_" prefix
  - "angle_type" (not "type")
  
  You must respond with ONLY a valid JSON object in this exact structure:

  IMPORTANT: Generate hooks for ALL angles provided in the SELECTED MARKETING ANGLES section.
  If 8 angles are provided, generate 8 angle objects. If 14 angles are provided, generate 14 angle objects.

  ⚠️ NOTE: The example below shows only 5 angles for brevity.
  You MUST generate hooks for ALL angles provided in the SELECTED MARKETING ANGLES section.
  If 14 angles are provided, generate 14 angle objects (angle_1 through angle_14).
  Continue the exact same structure shown in the example for angle_6, angle_7, angle_8, etc.
  DO NOT stop after 5 angles - process every single angle in the list.

context_integration: |
  Use the complete accumulated context to create targeted hooks:
  - Avatar analysis (demographics, psychographics, behavior, pain points)
  - Customer journey mapping (awareness, consideration, decision, action phases)
  - Objections analysis (barriers, concerns, hesitations)
  - Product information (name, features, benefits, differentiation)
  - Selected marketing angles (specific concepts and psychological triggers)
